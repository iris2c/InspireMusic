InspireMusic is a PyTorch library designed for research on music, song, and audio generation. It provides both inference and training code for AI generative models that produce high-quality music. The library features a unified framework that incorporates autoregressive Transformer and conditional flow-matching modeling, enabling controllable generation of music, songs, and audio with textual and music structural conditioning, along with neural audio tokenizers. Currently, InspireMusic supports tasks like text-to-music generation, with plans to extend capabilities to text-to-song and text-to-audio generation in the future.
